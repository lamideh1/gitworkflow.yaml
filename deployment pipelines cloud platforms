To meet the requirements of your CI/CD project and improve your scores across all the assessment criteria, here is a full and comprehensive guide from the beginning. This includes properly setting up GitHub Actions workflows for versioning, tagging, deploying to AWS, using semantic versioning, handling different environments, validating triggers, and more.

---

## âœ… **Lesson 1: Understanding Deployment Pipelines**

### **Deployment Stages**

1. **Development** â€“ Code is written and tested locally.
2. **Integration** â€“ Changes are merged to a shared branch like `dev` or `main`.
3. **Testing** â€“ Automated unit/integration tests are run.
4. **Staging** â€“ Code is deployed to a production-like environment.
5. **Production** â€“ Final live deployment for users.

### **Deployment Strategies**

* **Blue-Green Deployment**: Two environments; only one live at a time.
* **Canary Releases**: Small percentage of users get new code first.
* **Rolling Deployment**: Updates servers gradually with the new version.

---

## âœ… **Lesson 2: Automated Versioning and Releases**

### **Semantic Versioning (SemVer)**

* Format: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`
* Increment rules:

  * `MAJOR` for incompatible API changes.
  * `MINOR` for backward-compatible new features.
  * `PATCH` for bug fixes.

### **GitHub Action: Bump Version and Create Tag**

Create `.github/workflows/version.yml`:

```yaml
name: Bump version and tag
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
      - staging
jobs:
  bump-version:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Bump version and create tag
        uses: anothrNick/github-tag-action@1.61.0
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          DEFAULT_BUMP: patch  # Can be overridden by commit message label
```

> ðŸ§  Tip: Use `#major`, `#minor`, or `#patch` in commit messages to override the bump type.

---

## âœ… **Lesson 3: GitHub Releases Automation**

Add a second workflow `.github/workflows/create-release.yml`:

```yaml
name: Create Release
on:
  push:
    tags:
      - 'v*'
jobs:
  release:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Create GitHub release
        uses: actions/create-release@v1
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        with:
          tag_name: ${{ github.ref }}
          release_name: Release ${{ github.ref }}
          body: |
            Automated release based on tag.
```

---

## âœ… **Lesson 4: CI Pipeline - Test, Build, and Lint**

`.github/workflows/ci.yml`

```yaml
name: CI Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [main, staging, dev]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main, staging, dev]

jobs:
  build-and-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        node-version: [14.x, 16.x, 18.x]
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Setup Node.js ${{ matrix.node-version }}
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci

      - name: Lint
        run: npx eslint .

      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test

      - name: Cache Node Modules
        uses: actions/cache@v2
        with:
          path: ~/.npm
          key: ${{ runner.os }}-node-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json') }}
          restore-keys: |
            ${{ runner.os }}-node-
```

## âœ… **Lesson 5: Deploying to AWS (S3 or Beanstalk)**

### **Set Secrets:**

Go to GitHub â†’ Repo â†’ Settings â†’ Secrets â†’ Actions â†’ Add:

* `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
* `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`

### **Sample S3 Deployment Workflow**

`.github/workflows/deploy-s3.yml`

```yaml
name: Deploy to S3

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - production

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Setup AWS credentials
        uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v2
        with:
          aws-access-key-id: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
          aws-secret-access-key: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
          aws-region: us-west-2

      - name: Deploy to S3
        run: aws s3 sync ./dist s3://your-s3-bucket-name --delete
```

> ðŸ§  For Node.js or container apps, replace S3 with Elastic Beanstalk, ECS, or Lambda CLI commands.

## âœ… **Bonus: Multi-Environment Deployment (Staging & Prod)**

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - staging
      - production

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to environment
        run: |
          if [[ ${{ github.ref }} == 'refs/heads/production' ]]; then
            echo "Deploying to Production"
            # production deploy command
          else
            echo "Deploying to Staging"
            # staging deploy command
          fi
```

## âœ… **Improvements for Your Score**

| Criterion              | Actions Taken                                                                  |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Workflow Setup**     | Added pull\_request triggers, matrix builds, branch rules, and job conditions. |
| **Versioning**         | Used labels for version types and GitHub tagging action.                       |
| **Secrets/Cloud Auth** | Secrets clearly used, AWS credentials configured properly.                     |
| **Deployment**         | Sample full deployment to AWS with CI, versioning, and tagging steps.          |

Would you like me to generate these files or provide a repo template you can clone directly?
