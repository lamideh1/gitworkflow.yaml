Here is a **complete, step-by-step guide** for **Lessons 1 to 3** on deployment pipelines and using GitHub Actions for automated deployment, versioning, and cloud integration.

---

## **Lesson 1: Introduction to Deployment Pipelines**

### **Objectives:**

* Understand the stages of a deployment pipeline.
* Learn common deployment strategies.

---

### **Step 1: Understand Deployment Stages**

Here’s a simplified breakdown of each stage in a modern CI/CD pipeline:

1. **Development**

   * You write and test code on your local machine.

2. **Integration**

   * Push code to GitHub. Code is merged into the shared repository.

3. **Testing**

   * GitHub Actions runs automated unit/integration tests.

4. **Staging**

   * A copy of the app is deployed to a staging environment for final checks.

5. **Production**

   * The final version is released to actual users.

---

### **Step 2: Learn Deployment Strategies**

1. **Blue-Green Deployment:**
   Two identical environments (blue & green); traffic switches to green after successful deployment.

2. **Canary Releases:**
   New version is rolled out to a small number of users before full rollout.

3. **Rolling Deployment:**
   Instances are updated one-by-one or in batches without downtime.

---

## **Lesson 2: Automated Releases and Versioning**

### **Objectives:**

* Use semantic versioning.
* Automate version bumps and GitHub releases.

---

### **Step 1: Use Semantic Versioning**

Semantic versioning format:

```
MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH (e.g., 1.4.2)
```

---

### **Step 2: Automate Versioning with GitHub Actions**

#### **Create a GitHub Actions workflow file:**

1. Create: `.github/workflows/version.yml`

2. Paste this code:

```yaml
name: Bump version and tag

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  bump-version:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Bump version and push tag
        uses: anothrNick/github-tag-action@1.66.0
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          DEFAULT_BUMP: patch  # Change to minor or major as needed
```

This auto-increments the version and tags the commit when you push to `main`.

---

### **Step 3: Auto-Create GitHub Releases**

Create another file: `.github/workflows/release.yml`

```yaml
name: Create Release

on:
  push:
    tags:
      - '*'

jobs:
  release:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Create GitHub Release
        uses: actions/create-release@v1
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        with:
          tag_name: ${{ github.ref }}
          release_name: Release ${{ github.ref }}
```

This workflow creates a GitHub release every time a tag is pushed (automatically from the previous job).

---

## **Lesson 3: Deploying to Cloud Platforms**

### **Objectives:**

* Use GitHub Actions to deploy apps to cloud platforms.
* Manage secrets and deployment environments.

---

### **Step 1: Choose a Cloud Platform**

You can deploy to:

* **AWS** (most versatile for web apps, S3/EC2/Lambda)
* **Azure** (great for .NET, enterprise apps)
* **Google Cloud** (best for containerized apps, ML)

---

### **Step 2: Set Up GitHub Actions for Deployment (AWS Example)**

1. Create file: `.github/workflows/deploy-to-aws.yml`

2. Paste:

```yaml
name: Deploy to AWS

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Configure AWS credentials
        uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v1
        with:
          aws-access-key-id: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
          aws-secret-access-key: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
          aws-region: us-west-2

      - name: Deploy to AWS
        run: |
          # Example deployment command (adjust to your app)
          aws s3 sync ./build s3://your-s3-bucket-name
```

---

### **Step 3: Store Your Secrets in GitHub**

Go to your GitHub repo:

* Navigate to **Settings > Secrets and Variables > Actions**
* Add:

  * `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
  * `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`

---

### **Optional: Environment-specific Deployment**

Use conditions to deploy differently to dev/staging/prod:

```yaml
if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'  # Only deploy on main
```

Or use separate workflow files for each environment.

---

## **Wrap-Up**

Here’s what you now have:

| Lesson | What You Set Up                                           |
| ------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1**  | Full CI/CD pipeline understanding + deployment strategies |
| **2**  | Automatic version bumping + GitHub releases               |
| **3**  | Deployment to AWS using GitHub Actions with secrets       |
